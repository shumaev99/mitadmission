How would you feel if you dated with a genius? Well, I have had that kind of experience for a year. Oleksandr is an extraordinary and outstanding brainbox. To say a true, he is so all-rounded that I can’t discover him from all his sides. But I can definitely tell that I’m a person who knows him better than the other people, because we communicate at the highest level of trust. That is why I’m writing now this letter. 

Sasha is well known in the Ukrainian science world as one of the best physicist of all time of its independence. It is a true no one from his peers can match up to him. But in the other hand all his success came at a heavy piece. He threw out his school lessons and spent all the time on the physics. I think it requires being really stout-hearted to bet everything on your goal.

Although he work hard he even have a time to develop his others talents. For example he is a grate musician. As a sign of courtship he wrote for me two songs on piano which I found enchanting. Despite a fact that Oleksandr is a bit taciturn it is easy to find a topic to talk about to him. 

I must admit that his communication skills wish to be better. But he knows how to be a good friend, not in word, but in deeds. I have recently had very hard period in my life. Without his help I would never get it over. He just stayed and proved me that I always can count on him. Of course he as a vulnerable personality needs a lot of uplift too.

I know that Oleksandr wants to leave to USA so I like all his friends will miss him much. However, I see how he is encouraged about getting into MIT. Therefore I realized that it would be the best way to promote his talents. He has a great future, not here, but at the forefront of development of science.
