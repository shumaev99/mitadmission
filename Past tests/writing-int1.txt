The reading passage suggests existence of a so-called "universal risk-taker". Such a person takes a risk on itself for a low cost or without reward at all. This is considered pathological and described in the articles written in 1930s as a "death wish". The listening lecture refutes the existence of such a pure personality type. The lecturer points that the view of psychologists has changed a lot since 1930, when those articles were written. Anyone may take risks in some parts of his life, but not in all. For example, a trader carefully estimates the market changes in his work and then rides his motorbike in his leisure time.

First, the reading passage averts that some people take risks referred to their job, but some do it without expecting a reward. For example, the soldiers and lumberjacks have no choice and are forced to risk, but the teens racing on the streets do have. According to the lecture, however, the rewards exist, though not directly observed. There're physiological and even psychological rewards. Risky people tend to be more self-confident and socially adapted.

Second, the reading introduces an explanation of risky behavior. Some people do non-proficious and risky things to hide their inadequacy, like school-children. The lecture casts doubt on this argument, telling that it is sometimes important for anyone to take risks. Quite mentally healthy people practice dangerous experiences, so this can't serve as a measure of a person's psychological state.
