People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, increased knowledge). Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Colleges and universities are places made for people who want to comprehend their areas of interest in a deeper level. However, a college is not just a place to study.

Firstly, in a college one can find friends with common interests. Usually the students that enter a college have a defined set of life-wide goals and hobbies, and it's obviously useful for anyone to have friends with whom you share your targets and temptations. You can study and in a future maybe work together with these people.

In addition, many colleges promote project work and volunteering. Taking part in these activities does provide a level of experience for a future job, as youâ€™re left to work by yourself or with teammates.

To say more, colleges provide experience not only in your professional area. If you are not a local, then you have to live and deal with problems by yourself, probably in the dormitory with others like you. This helps you grow as a personality without help of relatives, which will be extremely useful in the future. Also, handling all the problems in a society makes you closer to others who live beside you.

To conclude, I think that there're various reasons why people attend colleges and universities, and merely studying the topics is not at all the most important one.
