Tell us about the most significant challenge you've faced or something that didn't go according to plan. How did you manage the situation? (200-250 words)

The first and the toughest challenge related to my science career was the choice of the science major. When I took part in the Scholar Olympiads in the 8th grade, I succeeded not only in physics, but also in math. I met Sergey Lifyts, my future math teacher at school, who prepared me for the Olympiad in math. I started thinking seriously about a career of a mathematician and studying mathematics. However, the results of the Regional Olympiad were disappointing: I took the 1st place in physics, but a mere 3rd place in math.

I was still admitted to the National Olympiad in math, but I lost a lot of self-confidence after the failure to win the Regional Olympiad. As a result, I decided to switch to physics. This was a challenging decision as I had to find a physics tutor and to prepare in short-term for the National Olympiad in physics. Nevertheless, I managed to accomplish both of these tasks. Zakhar Maizelis, my first physics tutor, explained the necessary material to me and trained me almost every day. The problems which Zakhar proposed were very difficult for me being a 8-grader, however they inspired me to study physics even more. Such an intense preparation impacted the result: I won the 1st place at the National Olympiad in physics.

After I had overcome this obstacle, it became easier for me to focus on studying physics. Eventually, I managed to bear fruit from my studies by winning two International Olympiads.
