I am sure that I want to have science and engineering as my job. I know that MIT has highly developed facilities for achieving my goal. Particularly, I am interested in the events hosted by the department of physics. For example, globally known scientists, such as Salvatore Vitale and Isaac Chuang, give lectures and seminars about cutting-edge research. I have read about MIT's projects in quantum physics and I am very happy that students have a chance to participate and maybe even discover new phenomena. That is why I want to enter the department of physics and become involved in MIT's science life.

I have a passion for physics. Particularly, I am interested in the range of courses, research opportunities and events in the department of physics. I have read about MIT's projects in quantum physics and I am very happy that students have a chance to participate in research (UROPs) and maybe even discover new phenomena. Also, I would look forward to attending lectures and colloquia about cutting-edge research by globally known scientists, such as Salvatore Vitale and Isaac Chuang.

Though I don't yet have a background, I would very much like to explore the field of aeronautics and astronomy at MIT.
