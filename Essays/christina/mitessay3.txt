I enjoy taking part in physics olympiads. Unfortunately, my school used to have no special classes for preparation for olympiads. I was disappointed by that, so I decided to create one.

I love the challenge of problem solving. When I first entered my high school, I used to study physics by myself. I enjoyed delving into new levels of understanding of forces of nature, but sometimes I felt isolated. I wanted to collaborate with my friends and achieve satisfaction that comes from shared understanding, so I created a physics club and invited my classmates to it. I took the most difficult problems that challenged me, and we tackled them together under guidance of our physics teacher. Subsequently, our results improved a lot: two of my classmates took prizes at the national olympiad. Moreover, we supported each other during the contests: when others were nervous, we helped each other calm down and perform at our best. During the olympiad period, we played and relaxed together, and so became close friends.

Studying physics with my peers appeals to me, and also I enjoy helping others who may be struggling with physics. My classmates who are not aspiring physicists, regularly ask me to explain the course material or help them understand the assigned problems. When I spend time explaining the concepts, in the process I'm also revising my own knowledge of science, and solidifying my understanding.

I found that both collaboration and teaching bring benefits for my growth as a scientist.
