I am devoted to physics and it brings a lot of pleasure to my life. Still, during my free time I practice many other exciting activities. For example, I enjoy constructing 3D models of real cars and aircrafts on my computer. It develops my spatial imagination and allows for creating a masterpiece. It is the ideal pastime for me as it  both conforms to my love of science and involves my artistic skills. I also like practicing art in another way: I love painting. I admire exact curves and shapes of the nature, and I depict objects with a scientific precision.
