There are many students in my school, and I personally know only a tiny part of them, the ones who have shown themselves outside of school. Christina is one of those. During her first year in the lyceum, the girl qualified for the National Olympiad in Physics, the competition for the best high school students of the whole country. She has been winning it every year since then. Also, she won several Regional Olympiads, in mathematics and astronomy.

In addition, Christina was also awarded numerous scholarships. Every year she's got the Governor's scholarship, which is usually given for remarkable success in scholastic contests, such as olympiads. In 2017, Christina received the Mayor's award, which the city government gives to 5 most talented and successful students of Lviv. Finally, every year she gets the school honors as the one of the best student of LPML.

About the grades, Christina is in the top 25 percent. She works hard on the physics olympiads, and I understand that it is not crucial for her to have the best GPA in class. In my opinion, Christina's brilliant success in olympiads is much more important and promising than 12.0 average grade.

Christina not only made herself famous, but also glorified the school that she's represented. Now, Lviv Physics & Mathematics Lyceum is nationally known and accepted as one of the best science high schools in Ukraine. In 2017, the school was declared the best scholar institution in Ukraine. I'm thankful to Christina, who elevates the recognition of the Lviv Lyceum to a higher level.
