It was very hard for me to overcome a prejudice about women in science in my region. Girls are rarely admitted to science lyceums: for example, in my school there are about 2 to 5 girls in a class of 30 people.

What makes things worse, some people think that women can not become scientists and technicians. My mother said I should get maried, be a humble wife, raise children. While other girls shared her opinion, I couldn't understand, I suffered. There was a painful internal struggle between my own desire and the world's expectations.

My physics teacher often humiliates girls in his class, by saying that they don't belong there. I'm the only girl who attended his extra classes, and he does not believe in my success, though he agrees I'm one of the best students. It hurt me greatly when I first entered the lyceum, worst of all was that I sometimes thought that was right and I was stupid in physics.

It was a tough job to start believing in myself despite all odds. I tracked my own progress and found out that they were wrong. Now I'm shocked, how many talented young girls give up under the pressure of discrimination. I talked to my female friends, and some of them began to believe more strongly in themselves and became more successful. I will show by my own example that women can be as smart as men. And I know, the world will change, and I can change it.
