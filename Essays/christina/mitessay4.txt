[249]

Before I entered the Lviv physics & mathematics lyceum, I used to study in an ordinary school. I was a very curious child, and I loved to study new things in science. I read popular books and shared my passion with my peers. But unfortunately, they did not understand me, so I felt myself alienated. Sometimes I thought I was too nerdy and strange.

Entering the lyceum changed my point of view greatly. I met people who had similar interests and understood my passion. I treated them as my family, and gained a lot of self-confidence and will to self-improvement. 

The lyceum also taught me how to deal with challenges. The first year in the new school was a pain, because it was hard to catch up with the complicated material. But I didn't give up; on the contrary, this stimulating atmosphere inspired me to pursue a strong performance in the physics olympiads. I worked out an efficient strategy of studying and used it to prepare for olympiads, and it helped me: I got a prize on the national olympiad the next year!

Also, at the lyceum I was required to do many subjects on a relatively high level. But I wanted to focus on physics and math, so I taught myself to manage my time, in order to both satisfy the requirements for other subjects and devote myself to science.

I think that the lyceum shaped my fighting character and gave me the opportunity to believe in myself.
