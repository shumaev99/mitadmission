Physics brings a lot of pleasure to my life. Still, during my free time I practice many other exciting activities. For example, I enjoy constructing 3D models of real cars and aircrafts on my computer. It develops my spatial imagination, and I feel an enormous satisfaction at creating a "masterpiece". It is an ideal pastime for me as it both connects to my love of science and involves my artistic skills. I also like practicing art in another way: I love painting. I admire the exact curves and shapes of nature, and in my paintings I depict objects with a scientific precision.
